### ROR (Research Organization Registry) as Author Identifier Type 

ROR (Research Organization Registry) has been added as an Author Identifier Type (alongside ORCID, etc.) for when the author is an organization rather than a person. See <https://ror.org>, #11075, and #11118.

## Upgrade Instructions

6\. Update metadata blocks

These changes reflect incremental improvements made to the handling of core metadata fields. Expect the loading of the citation block to take several seconds because of its size (especially due to the number of languages).

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQSS/dataverse/v6.6/scripts/api/data/metadatablocks/citation.tsv

curl http://localhost:8080/api/admin/datasetfield/load -H "Content-type: text/tab-separated-values" -X POST --upload-file citation.tsv
```
