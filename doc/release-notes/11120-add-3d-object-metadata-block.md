### New 3D Object Data Metadata Block

A new metadata block has been added for describing 3D object data. You can download it from the [guides](https://dataverse-guide--11167.org.readthedocs.build/en/11167/user/appendix.html). See also #11120 and #11167.

All new Dataverse installations will receive this metadata block by default. We recommend adding it by following the upgrade instructions below.
